 I have "bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality  The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better  My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most 
 Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts   the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted  Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as "Jumbo" 
 This is a confection that has been around a few centuries   It is a light  pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts  And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar   And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven   Not too chewy  and very flavorful   I highly recommend this yummy treat   If you are familiar with the story of C S  Lewis' "The Lion  The Witch  and The Wardrobe" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch
